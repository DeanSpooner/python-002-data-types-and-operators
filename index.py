# Subscripting: pulls the character at the [numbered index after]
print("Hello"[4])
# Should result in 'o' being printed

# Integer: numbers w/o decimals
print(45 + 50)
# Should result in 95

# If larger numbers are wanted to be written, we can use underscores like commas e.g.:
print(12_862_510)
# Should result in 12862510

# Float: decimals

# Boolean, True/False with capital to start
